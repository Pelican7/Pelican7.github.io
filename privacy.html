                <p class="section-text">This Privacy Policy describes how Pelican 7 ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of our mobile application, "Lily" (the "App").</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Data Collection: None</h2>
                <p class="section-text">Our App is designed to collect no personal information. We do not use analytics services, third-party advertising, or any features that require us to collect, store, or share your personal data, such as your name, email, location, or unique device identifiers. We do not track your activity across other apps or websites.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">On-Device Processing</h2>
                <p class="section-text">All gameplay, progress, and settings for "Lily" are stored locally on your device. We do not transmit your game data to any external servers. If you delete the App, your local data will be removed in accordance with your device’s operating system rules.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Apple Privacy Manifests</h2>
                <p class="section-text">In compliance with Apple’s security standards, our App includes a Privacy Manifest file. This discloses the use of standard internal system APIs (such as Disk Space or System Boot Time) used by the Unity engine for core app functionality. These APIs are used solely for the app's performance and stability and are never used for user tracking or fingerprinting.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p class="section-text">We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our app or legal requirements. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

                <p class="section-text">If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: hello@pelican7.com</p>
